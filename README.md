# Inconsistent `calc()` Behavior in CSS Across Browsers

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the CSS `calc()` function.  The problem involves unexpected results and inconsistencies across different browsers when using `calc()` with complex expressions or mixed units.

## The Problem

The core issue lies in how browsers interpret and evaluate calculations within the `calc()` function, especially when multiple units (e.g., pixels, percentages, ems) or nested calculations are involved.  While simple `calc()` expressions usually work fine, more complex ones can lead to unexpected output or even rendering errors.

## Reproduction

The `bug.css` file contains CSS code that exhibits the inconsistent behavior. You can see the inconsistent width of elements in different browsers by including it in a simple HTML page.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file offers a solution by simplifying the `calc()` expression or refractoring the CSS to avoid complex unit conversion issues.  The main focus should be on keeping units consistent within the `calc()` expression, using parentheses carefully, and avoiding deeply nested calculations if possible. 

Always test your `calc()` expressions across various browsers to ensure consistent rendering.
